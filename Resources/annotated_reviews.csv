Camera is definitely a upgrade over the previous generation.
Design outside remains the same. Pastel colours with matte finish.

"1. It is the best phone and worth every rupee in terms of its user interface, unique eco system, siri and some other options which can be copied by other manufacturers but cant replicate (if incase a person thinks iphones are bit overpriced - they are pricing for their unique features)
2. In terms of camera, display, performance and in every other aspect it gives best output.
3. In terms of this iPhone 15 series, the upgrade in this series is of leaps and bounds compared to other upgrades ...

"Long time android user. Thought of giving iOS a try.
And now I understand why apple is apple. The highlight is the interaction between the hardware and the software.
Android feels clunky in front of iOS. (Have used all Android skins and currently on s24+)",positive

"iPhone is always the best in every quality category. Earlier, there were battery backup issues, but I am getting more than a day of battery backup. The island display in the basic model is really exciting, which was earlier in the Pro model only. I recommend you guys to go for it without any thought, if you don't require a high refresh rate display.",positive

"I was sceptical at first about moving form an android to ios. I was confused between s23 and ip15 but i bought this phone and i must say i am very happy about it. I have not faced any issues in this device since I have been using it, no heating while gaming, charges quickly, and believe me if you have been using 60hz panel before this you will not have any problems but coming from a 120hz panel you might need some time adjusting to it. All in all this has got to be the best phone under 70k ca...
