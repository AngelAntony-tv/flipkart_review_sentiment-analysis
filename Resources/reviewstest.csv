Design and performance is good. But somehow I felt the quality and standard is not the same as it used to be. It does heat up while charging and prolonged usage. This is unexpected and unacceptable. Also there are connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay.
"Coming from iphone 12 mini.
Camera is definitely a upgrade over the previous generation.
Design outside remains the same. Pastel colours with matte finish.
The Dynamic Island is what i liked for the notification part.
Processor of previous generation pro models.
Overall a value for money among the 15 models.
Got it a great deal in flipkart clubbing exchange and bank offers.
Delivery was on time."

"A Mixed Bag of Brilliance

The iPhone 15 flaunts an impressive camera setup, capturing moments with exceptional clarity and detail. However, users may encounter heating issues post 80% charge, which could disrupt prolonged usage. Occasionally, screen touch glitches may hamper the otherwise seamless user experience. Despite these setbacks, the iPhone 15 excels in performance and features. The standout Dynamic Island feature enhances productivity and personalization. Overall, the iPhone 15 is a...

Everything is good. Battery backup is hardly 6hrs will come while continuously usage. Camera is fantastic. In this iphone 60 hz refreshing rate is equals to 120hz refresh rate in android. Very light weight.

I already have an Android phone which is less than 50% of its price and still is better in every aspect except the camera.
Well! Definitely, iphone 15 has a flagship level chipset but I am not a gamer and a normal user and I find mid rangers and flagship all perform at similar level in daily tasks.
While iphone 15 only has 60hz screen which feels choppy, all other phones have 120-144hz scr...

Not justifying the price .. bit disappointed about the display (refresh rate should be high).. no differences between 12 and 15 except brightness .. those who willing to upgrade plz be ok with your 13 .. there is very low difference in day to day life use..but the Dynamic Island is awesome it is way better than expected..

The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera."

"Long time android user. Thought of giving iOS a try.
And now I understand why apple is apple. The highlight is the interaction between the hardware and the software.
Android feels clunky in front of iOS. (Have used all Android skins and currently on s24+)"
Must buy!

"iPhone is always the best in every quality category. Earlier, there were battery backup issues, but I am getting more than a day of battery backup. The island display in the basic model is really exciting, which was earlier in the Pro model only. I recommend you guys to go for it without any thought, if you don't require a high refresh rate display."

"Got it in republic day sale however price has been slashed after that, you feel bad if you have already paid extra for it.

Offers for Flipkart Axis bank card was discontinued that time.
I own s23 ultra as well the handy feel of iPhone is non comparable."

"I upgraded because of the band that is 5G and a better camera , look wise it is good and weight is comfortable to carry. Dynamic Island if catchy to eye. It keeps the Apple standard, gels well with Apple ecosystem like AirPods , iwatch, mac . Though a little pricey at this point but one may wait for or some sort of discount offers."
Most value for money iPhone ever.

"Great phone , worth the money"
"I was sceptical at first about moving form an android to ios. I was confused between s23 and ip15 but i bought this phone and i must say i am very happy about it. I have not faced any issues in this device since I have been using it, no heating while gaming, charges quickly, and believe me if you have been using 60hz panel before this you will not have any problems but coming from a 120hz panel you might need some time adjusting to it. All in all this has got to be the best phone under 70k ca...
